# go-hello

Real basic CRUD app to keep track of a grocery list. Built using Go's standard `http` library, [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic front-end functionality, and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for peristant storage.

To get started you should be able to build and run an executable at the root level of the project:
```
go run .
```
